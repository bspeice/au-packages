## Notable

### Markdown-Based

Notes are written in Markdown, plus you can write KaTeX expressions, Mermaid diagrams and more, check out our built-in Markdown cheatsheet.

Notable provides a very powerful Markdown editor, it's the same one VS Code uses in fact, so features like multi-cursors, a minimap and best-in-class syntax highlighting are built-in.

### No Vendor Lock-In

Notes and attachments are simply stored on your disk, this is extremely portable and powerful: you could edit your notes via a third-party editor on mobile, have them synchronized via Dropbox, use Git, run a regex-based search and replace etc.

### Dark Theme

A dark theme is also available. In the future support for custom themes will be added as well.

### Zen Mode

Zen mode provides a minimalistic editing and reading experience, hiding everything that's not necessary.

Notable is also keyboard friendly, has a quick open window, and we'll soon add a command palette too, so you won't have to click any buttons if you don't want to.

### Multi-Note Editor

A multi-note editor is available for performing an action, like favoriting, pinning, deleting, tagging etc., on multiple notes at once.

### Split Editor

A split-editor is available for quickly checking out how your note will be rendered while you're editing it.
